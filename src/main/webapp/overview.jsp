        <h1>Wildbook: Where people, machine learning, and animals connect</h1>

        <p>Wildbook is a free, online resource, established to strengthen the global conservation of all manner of
                animals. A catalyst for collaboration, Wildbook enables researchers to manage, share, analyze and
                archive data via pioneering, user friendly software. Wildbook unites researchers, conservationists and
                citizen scientists, enables connections with individual animals, and provides robust data to inform
                conservation of animals and their habitats. </p>


        <h2>Why use Wildbook?</h2>

        <p>
                No researcher is equipped to traverse the vast distances required to study animals consistently and
                without gaps. Wildbook's powerful data management, photo matching algorithms, and analysis tools
                consolidate existing research and connect data to provide global scale information for researchers and
                conservation groups.
        </p>
        <p>
                For the first time, Wildbook provides a place for researchers, conservationists and citizen scientists
                to work together to fill the gaps in our knowledge of these incredible species.
        </p>


        <h2>What does Wildbook do?</h2>
        <p>
                Wildbook uses photographs of patterns, body parts, and scars to distinguish between individual animals.
                Identify your animal in as few as three clicks - rapid identification is achieved using pattern
                recognition and photo management technology. Anyone can contribute to Wildbook. All you need is to
                submit your photos with the time and location of the sighting, as well as any other sighting
                information, and Wildbook can do the rest.</p>


        <h3>Manage and backup your data</h3>
        <p>Import your photos and sightings data in many common picture formats to view your sightings online, follow
                individuals you have identified, add metadata, manage individual data, and much more. Having your data
                in Wildbook also serves as a free backup service.
        </p>

        <h3>Researchers control their own data</h3>
        <p>Researchers keep full ownership and control access to their data in Wildbook. Permission settings allow you
                to choose who has access to your data and allows for easy collaboration between groups. Wildbook can be
                used within organizations to allow web-based access to data and matching without sharing any data beyond
                your organization. Multiple team members, in multiple locations, on multiple computers can all work on
                the same dataset at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>Wildbook enables collaboration when photoidentification matches are made. The potential match list will be
                redacted if your sharing is turned off. You will be able to see that your individuals potentially match
                other datasets, but you cannot access the data until both data owners agree to privately and
                reciprocally share access. By doing this, Wildbook allows for the compilation of datasets for
                multi-institutional collaborative projects.
        </p>

        <h3>Analysis tools</h3>
        <p>Wildbook provides tools for managing photoidentification, molecular sampling, and sightings databases and
                includes a growing number of features to help users work with additional software by linking to external
                programs.
        </p>

        <h3>Archive: saving information for the future</h3>
        <p>Collecting animal identification data takes enormous time, effort and funding, and can also impact the
                animals over time. We believe these data provide invaluable records about the oceans and should be
                preserved for future generations. A generation from now, how will these populations have changed? Will
                your data be available to help answer new questions about socio-ecology, haplotype evolution, and more
                change by the next generation of conservationists? To support this, Wildbook's data can be exported in a
                number of formats and its infrastructure for archiving identification datasets will be stored on servers
                in the cloud.
        </p>


        <h3>Build networks and strengthen research</h3>
        <p>All photographic, location, and supplementary data, once imported to Wildbook, are in the same format. This
                feature, together with the ability to share your data privately with specific collaborators, overcomes
                one of the major hurdles to combining disparate, international datasets. This makes Wildbook a powerful
                tool for researchers looking for collaborators, prospective graduate students, conservation groups
                looking for data to help advocacy goals, government developing management plans, and people hoping to
                change the world.
        </p>
