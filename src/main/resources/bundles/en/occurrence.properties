mappingnote = If you zoom in too quickly, Google Maps may claim that it does not have the needed maps. Zoom back out, wait a few seconds to allow maps to load in the background, and then zoom in again.<br /><br />If more than one GPS point is available for the occurrence, the map also displays chevrons to guide you from the first sighting (shown as a green icon) to each subsequent sighting over time. The chevrons do NOT represent a path of travel, just a sequential link between sightings across time.
