# Info on the howtocarousel, outer and inner.
# For the inner sections the text is grouped by the <h3> and <p> tags.
carouselPhoto = \u0020Photograph an animal
carouselSubmit = \u0020Submit photo
carouselVerify = \u0020Researcher verification
carouselMatching = \u0020Matching process
carouselResult = \u0020Match result

innerPhotoH3 = Photograph the ID area
innerPhotoP = Animals with patterned features can often be identified uniquely. By taking a picture, you can match that pattern to others already in the database. Your animal might be new to the database, or it might be a new sighting of one we have seen before!

innerSubmitH3 = Submit PhotoID or sighting
innerSubmitP = You can upload files from your computer, or take them directly from your Flickr or Facebook account. Be sure to enter when and where you saw the animal, and add other information, such as species or sex, if you can. You will receive email updates when your animal is processed.

innerVerifyH3 = Researcher verification
innerVerifyP = When you submit an identification photo, a local researcher receives a notification. This researcher will double check that the information you submitted is correct (so don't worry if you are unsure about which species you saw!).

innerMatchingH3 = Matching process
innerMatchingP =  Once a researcher is happy with all the data accompanying the identification photo, they will look for a photo match, using multiple computer assisted algorithms. It's like facial recognition software for animals.

innerResultH3 = Matching Results
innerResultP = Wildbook uses computer vision to compare new IDs to the existing database. Researchers then visually confirm a match to an existing animal in the database, or create a new individual profile.
