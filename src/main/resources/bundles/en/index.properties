reportEncounter = Report Encounter
mainSplash =  Wildbook helps you study, identify, and protect cetaceans worldwide
howItWorksH = Machine Learning & Citizen Science & Conservation Research
howItWorksHDescription = Wildbook applies computer vision algorithms and deep learning to identify and track individual animals across hundreds of thousands of photos. We help researchers collaborate with each other and citizen scientists contribute to the effort. A.I. scales and speeds research and conservation.
howItWorks1 = Step 1. Deep Learning Finds Animals
howItWorks1Description = We train computer vision to find individual animals in photos and identify the species. 
howItWorks2 = Step 2. Algorithms and Neural Networks Identify Individuals
howItWorks2Description = When we know where each animal is, we can identify them individually using algorithms that make digital "fingerprints" for each animal, looking for unique patterns. We replace hours of human labor with just a few minutes of computer vision, scanning for matches across tens of thousands of photos.
howItWorks3 = One Platform, Many Species, Many Researchers
howItWorks3Description = We can identify individuals of these species using fully automated computer vision:
howItWorks4 = Step 3. Population Dynamics Define Conservation Action
howItWorks4Description = If we can quickly track individuals in a population, we can model size and migration to generate new insights and support rapid, data-driven conservation action.
moreSoon = and more soon!

# Info on the howtocarousel, outer and inner.
# For the inner sections the text is grouped by the <h3> and <p> tags.
carouselPhoto = \u0020Photograph an animal
carouselSubmit = \u0020Submit photo
carouselVerify = \u0020Researcher verification
carouselMatching = \u0020Matching process
carouselResult = \u0020Match result

innerPhotoH3 = Photograph the ID area
innerPhotoP = Animals with patterned features can often be identified uniquely, such as by the distinctive coloration. By taking a picture, you can match that pattern to others already in the database. Your animal might be new to the database, or it might be a new sighting of one we have seen before!

innerSubmitH3 = Submit PhotoID or sighting
innerSubmitP = You can upload files from your computer. Be sure to enter when and where you saw the animal, and add other information, such as species or sex, if you can. You will receive email updates when your animal is processed.

innerVerifyH3 = Researcher verification
innerVerifyP = When you submit an identification photo, a local researcher receives a notification. This researcher will double check that the information you submitted is correct (so don't worry if you are unsure about which species you saw!).

innerMatchingH3 = Matching process
innerMatchingP =  Once a researcher is happy with all the data accompanying the identification photo, they will look for a photo match, using multiple computer assisted algorithms and machine learning. It's like facial recognition software for animals.

innerResultH3 = Matching Results
innerResultP = Wildbook uses computer vision to compare new IDs to the existing database. Researchers then visually confirm a match to an existing animal in the database, or create a new individual profile.
