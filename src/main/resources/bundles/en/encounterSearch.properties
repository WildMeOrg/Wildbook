leaveBlank = Leave blank to accept all locations in your search. This field IS NOT case-sensitive.
locationID = Location ID is:
locationIDExample = Leave blank to accept all values in your search. You can select multiple values.
submitterName = Submitter or photographer name or email address contains:
additionalComments = Observation comments include string:
namesBlank = Leave blank to accept all names in your search. This field IS NOT case-sensitive.
commentsBlank = Leave blank to ignore. This field IS NOT case-sensitive.
