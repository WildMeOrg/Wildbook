### ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### NOTE: For i18n reasons, some resources also need to be defined in "commonCoreInternational.properties"
###       The current i18n solution for these resources is not ideal, as it requires duplication of
###       English resources in this file for correct operation, as these values are also used for data
###       storage, which complicates matters. This solution was the quickest practical way to implelement
###       i18n given the current application design, but ideally this should change (but would likely
###       require database changes).
