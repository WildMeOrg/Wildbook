# Habitat package: Wildbook
Wildbook blends structured wildlife research with artificial intelligence, citizen science, and computer vision to speed population analysis and develop new insights to help fight extinction. Here is our vision in one minute.

## Description

WildbookÂ® is an open source software framework to support collaborative mark-recapture, molecular ecology, and social ecology studies, especially where citizen science and artificial intelligence can help scale up projects. It is developed by the non-profit Wild Me (PI Jason Holmberg) and research partners at the University of Illinois-Chicago (PI Tanya Berger-Wolf), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (PI Charles V. Stewart), and Princeton University (PI Daniel Rubenstein).

Wildbook provides a technical foundation (database, APIs, computer vision, etc.) for wildlife research projects that are:

* tracking individual animals in a wildlife population using natural markings , genetic identifiers, or vocalizations
* collecting biological samples from a wildlife population and performing genetic and/or chemical analyses (e.g., stable isotope measurements, haplotype determination, etc.)
* engaging citizen scientists and\or using social media to collect sighting information
* looking to build a collaborative, distributed research network for a migratory and/or global species
* looking to develop a new animal biometrics solution (e.g., pattern matching from photos) for one or more species
* collecting behavioral and/or social data for a wildlife study population
